### Hey! I'm Lumberjack 

Years ago, I started building software for the sake of killing boredom and experimenting with new stuff.

Being enthusiastic about tech, I developed the habit of aiming to go off-limits and coming up with ideas that solve different problems for both devs and end users. 

I am more interested in making web/cloud solutions and empowering that with systems programming.
