### Hey! i'm DeadBeef

Years ago, i started building software for the sake of killing boredom and experimenting with a new stuff.

Being enthusiastic towards tech, i developed the habit of aiming to go off limits and coming with ideas that solve different problems for both devs and end users. 

I more interested in making web/cloud solutions and empowering that with systems programming.
