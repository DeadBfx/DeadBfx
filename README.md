### Hey! i'm eHoriz0n

Years ago, i started building software for the sake of killing boredom and experimenting with a new stuff. it was and still a really interesting topic for me.

Being enthusiastic towards tech and afraid of being obeselte/average dev, i developed the habit of going off limits and coming with ideas that solve different problems for both devs and users. 

I became more serious about making web/cloud solutions and empowered that with low level and system programming.
